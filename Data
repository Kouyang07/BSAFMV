Player Detection and Tracking
Player location: x, y coordinates of the player's center of mass or bounding box
Player velocity: horizontal and vertical components of the player's velocity (pixels/frame or m/s)
Player acceleration: horizontal and vertical components of the player's acceleration (pixels/frame^2 or m/s^2)
Action Recognition and Classification
Action type: classification of the player's action (e.g., forehand, backhand, serve, volley)
Action frequency: frequency of the action (actions/minute or actions/rally)
Shot Tracking and Analysis
Ball location: x, y coordinates of the ball's center
Ball velocity: horizontal and vertical components of the ball's velocity (pixels/frame or m/s)
Ball acceleration: horizontal and vertical components of the ball's acceleration (pixels/frame^2 or m/s^2)
Shot type: classification of the shot (e.g., forehand, backhand, smash, clear)
Shot speed: speed of the shot (m/s)
Shot direction: direction of the shot (degrees)
Court Detection and Analysis
Court layout: x, y coordinates of the court's corners and lines
Player position: position of the player with respect to the court (e.g., near the net, at the baseline)
Player movement: movement patterns of the player within the court (e.g., distance covered, speed)
Event Detection and Analysis
Rally duration: duration of the rally (frames or seconds)
Rally outcome: outcome of the rally (e.g., winner, error, let)
Point outcome: outcome of the point (e.g., winner, error, let)
Game outcome: outcome of the game (e.g., winner, loser)
Once you have these raw detection values, you can use them to calculate more advanced metrics, such as:
Player skill level (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced)
Player performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, speed, strategy)
Game strategy metrics (e.g., serve effectiveness, shot distribution)
These metrics can be used to provide insights into player performance, identify areas for improvement, and develop personalized training plans.
